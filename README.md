* [getUserMedia](https://tony-xlh.github.io/web-camera-zoom/getUserMedia.html). Use WebRTC's getUserMedia to open the camera and control zoom directly. It works on limited browsers.
* [camera enhancer](https://tony-xlh.github.io/web-camera-zoom/cameraEnhancer.html). Use [Dynamsoft Camera Enhancer](https://www.dynamsoft.com/camera-enhancer/docs/core/introduction/) to open the camera and control zoom. It is based on getUserMedia and it provides a unified zoom function which works on all browsers.
